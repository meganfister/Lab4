## Introduction



## Methods
### Instruments
• A Bread Board

• Two DC Power supplies

• A Digital Multimeter

• A Function Generator

• An Oscilloscope

• Resistors: 1 kΩ, 4.7 kΩ, 8.2 kΩ, 22 kΩ, two 68 kΩ, 220 kΩ, 330 kΩ, 1.5 MΩ

• Capacitors: 1nF and 100 nF

• An LM741 Op Amp

• A 10 kΩ trimmer potentiometer

#### Part 1 - Limits of Op Amps
To begin, we constructed the unity gain inverting op amp circuit that is pictured below.

#### Part 2 - Op Amps and Frequency Response


## Results

### Part 1 - Limits of Op Amps

### Part 2 - Op Amps and Frequency Response


## Discussion
### Part 1 - Limits of Op Amps
_Compare the performance of each amplifier circuit to its expected theoretical performance with regard to gain._

_Comment on the limits of op-amp circuits with respect to maximum output voltage._

_Are the LM741 op amps symmetric i.e. does the positive voltage performance equal the negative voltage performance?_


### Part 2 - Op Amps and Frequency Response
_Did the integrating and differentiating circuits perform the mathematical operations expected? Explain._

## Conclusion
