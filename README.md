## Introduction



## Methods
### Instruments
• A Bread Board

• Two DC Power supplies

• A Digital Multimeter

• A Function Generator

• An Oscilloscope

• Resistors: 1 kΩ, 4.7 kΩ, 8.2 kΩ, 22 kΩ, two 68 kΩ, 220 kΩ, 330 kΩ, 1.5 MΩ

• Capacitors: 1nF and 100 nF

• An LM741 Op Amp

• A 10 kΩ trimmer potentiometer

#### Part 1 - Limits of Op Amps
To begin, we constructed the unity gain inverting op amp circuit that is pictured below.

Next, we constructued the moderate gain inverting op amp circuit that is pictured below.

#### Part 2 - Op Amps and Frequency Response


## Results

### Part 1 - Limits of Op Amps
*****Drive the voltage divider with the positive and negative voltage supplies.
*****Collect Vo vs. Vi data by adjusting the potentiometer to change the input voltage
|$V_i$ (V)|$V_o$ (V)|
|---|---|
|15.00|  -12.91 |
|13.99| -12.92  |
|12.00|  -11.90  |
|5.000|  -4.946 |
|0.004| 0.012   |
|-5.041|  5.018  |
|-12.00|  11.92  |
|-14.00|  13.91 |
|-14.99| 14.24   |

****Prepare a graph showing the lab data as scattered points around the line for the expected gain (consider actual resistor values)


### Part 2 - Op Amps and Frequency Response


## Discussion
### Part 1 - Limits of Op Amps
_Compare the performance of each amplifier circuit to its expected theoretical performance with regard to gain._

_Comment on the limits of op-amp circuits with respect to maximum output voltage._

_Are the LM741 op amps symmetric i.e. does the positive voltage performance equal the negative voltage performance?_


### Part 2 - Op Amps and Frequency Response
_Did the integrating and differentiating circuits perform the mathematical operations expected? Explain._

## Conclusion
